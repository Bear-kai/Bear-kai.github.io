I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Machine Vision and Intelligence Group (MVIG) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of Prof. Cewu Lu. Before that, I received my master's degree at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), under the supervision of Prof. Junwei Han. My research interests mainly include image recognition and point-cloud understanding. :laughing:
